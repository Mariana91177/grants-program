# Grants program
Waves Grants is a grant program introduced by the Waves Association for individual blockchain developers, teams and start-ups willing and able to implement ideas that serve the Waves ecosystem‚Äôs interests.

Waves Grants provides funding to developers building solutions that meet the needs of the rapidly accelerating Waves ecosystem, as well as to innovative projects that share Waves Tech‚Äôs mission to foster mass adoption of blockchain-based solutions.

We encourage developers to create solutions for specific use cases. However, ideas related to other aspects of blockchain are also welcome.

**In 2020-2021 the Waves Association aims to award grants for 1,000,000 WAVES to amplify inter-chain development**

## üî∑ Funding

The amount of funding is determined on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the complexity of technical requirements, specifics of a suggested solution, needs of the developer / team, the scale and importance of the project for Waves and other criteria.

All payments are made in WAVES and/or USDN (algorithmic stablecoin on the Waves protocol). The payment process is determined individually and depends on the project implementation schedule.
